In this project, arduino uno microcontroller and esp8266 module are used. Ublox gps module is used to determine current location and send this data by using tcp/ip over esp8266 module to a computer which is connected to same local network with esp8266. In computer side, python code is developed to read gps and temperature value and generate temperature map.
